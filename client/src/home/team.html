              <em>Founder/Developer. </em>
              Nick DiQuattro holds a PhD from UC Davis in Cognitive Neuroscience. He was inspired to build Marks after trying to find his girlfriend a suitable gradebook app
              to start her teaching career with and found all options lacking. He hopes Marks will make the lives of teachers easier while improving the education of children.
              This is his <a href="http://www.ndiquattro.me/img/pacino.jpg">dog</a>.
